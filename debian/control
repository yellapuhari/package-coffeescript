Description: interpreter and compiler for the CoffeeScript language
 CoffeeScript is a little language that compiles into JavaScript.
 Underneath all of those embarrassing braces and semicolons, JavaScript
 has always had a gorgeous object model at its heart. CoffeeScript is an
 attempt to expose the good parts of JavaScript in a simple way.
 .
 The golden rule of CoffeeScript is: "It's just JavaScript". The code
 compiles one-to-one into the equivalent JS, and there is no
 interpretation at runtime. You can use any existing JavaScript library
 seamlessly (and vice-versa). The compiled output is readable and
 pretty-printed, passes through JavaScript Lint without warnings, will
 work in every JavaScript implementation, and tends to run as fast or
 faster than the equivalent handwritten JavaScript.

 This package contains the development tool cake, comparable to Make and
 Rake but for Cakefile "recipes" written in the CoffeeScript language.

 This package contains a concatenated and compressed version of the
 CoffeeScript compiler. To use it in the browser, include the script
 after any inline script tags of type "text/coffeescript" on the page.
 It will compile and evaluate all of the scripts in order.
