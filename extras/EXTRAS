EXTRAS:

"extras/coffee-script.js" is a concatenated and compressed version of the 
CoffeeScript compiler. To use it in the browser, include the script after any 
inline script tags of type "text/coffeescript" on the page. It will compile
and evaluate all of the scripts in order.


This folder also includes a CoffeeScript syntax highlighter for Vim.
To install, copy "coffee.vim" into the "syntax" directory of
your vim72, and enable it in either of the following two ways:

  * Manually, by running `:set syntax=coffee`
  
  * Or automatically, by creating a "filetype.vim" file within "~/.vim", which
    contains something along these lines:
    
    if exists("did_load_filetypes")
      finish
    end
    augroup filetypedetect
      au! BufRead,BufNewFile *.coffee setfiletype coffee
    augroup END
